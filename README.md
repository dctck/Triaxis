🎯 Strategy Tips
Early Game (Rounds 1-3)

Focus on Metal T1 for +1⚙️ per round
Build resource engine in your strong suit
Don't spend everything - save for combos

Mid Game (Rounds 4-6)

Get at least one T2 engine
Start trading excess resources
Watch opponent's VP count

Late Game (Rounds 7+)

Push for T3 engines
Use Denial if opponent near win
Calculate paths to 18 VP

Draft Priority

High dice (5-6) for Insight
Medium dice (3-4) for Energy
Low dice (1-2) for Metal (unless T2)

Action Priority

Buy T3 engines when possible (VP + powerful effects)
Trade when stuck with 3+ unusable resources
Deny when opponent has 12+ Metal or 15+ VP
Pass if saving for next turn

🔥 Pro Tips
Snake Draft Advantage:

Second picker gets 2 consecutive picks = better combos
First picker gets last die = more predictable
Alternate start means each player gets advantage every other round

Time Management:

Don't overthink - 60 seconds goes fast!
Have a backup plan before your turn
Pass early if saving resources for big purchase next turn

Resource Management:

Keep 2-3 of each type if possible
Don't hoard - use or trade excess
Metal T3 expensive but powerful

VP Tracking:

Most VP comes from T2/T3 engines
Each T2 or T3 (except Metal) = 1 VP
Metal T3 gives +2 VP every round (powerful!)
Insight T3 gives +1 VP per use

🐛 Troubleshooting
"Not your turn" during draft:

Check top of screen for whose turn
Snake draft means different order each pick

Can't complete action:

Check if you already acted (UI grayed out)
Check if you have resources for that action
Check timer - might have expired

Waiting forever:

Check opponent's connection status
Timer should auto-resolve after 60 seconds
Refresh if stuck (session persists!)

Actions not appearing:

Make sure you're in action phase (not draft)
Check if your actionComplete flag is set
Try refreshing the page
